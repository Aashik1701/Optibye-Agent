## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v1.x to v2.0

The v2.0 release introduces a significant architectural change from monolithic to microservices. Here's how to migrate:

#### 1. Backup Your Data
```bash
# Backup MongoDB data
mongodump --uri="your-mongodb-uri" --out=backup_v1

# Backup configuration files
cp config.py config_v1_backup.py
```

#### 2. Update Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy new environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Migrate your existing configuration to new format
# Old format (config.py) -> New format (.env + YAML)
```

#### 3. Update Deployment Method
```bash
# Old deployment (single app)
python app.py

# New deployment (microservices)
./deploy.sh
# or
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 4. Update API Calls
The API structure has changed slightly:

```python
# Old API calls (v1.x)
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api/data")

# New API calls (v2.0)
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data")
```

#### 5. Update Database Schema
```bash
# Run migration script
python scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.py

# Verify data integrity
python scripts/verify_migration.py
```

#### 6. Update Monitoring
```bash
# Setup new monitoring stack
docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana

# Import dashboard configurations
python scripts/import_dashboards.py
```

### Breaking Changes in v2.0

1. **API Endpoints**: All API endpoints now include `/api/v1/` prefix
2. **Configuration**: Configuration moved from `config.py` to YAML files and environment variables
3. **Database**: Schema changes for improved performance (automatic migration provided)
4. **Authentication**: New JWT-based authentication system (old session-based auth deprecated)
5. **Deployment**: Docker Compose now required for full functionality

### Compatibility Notes

- **Python Version**: Now requires Python 3.9+ (previously 3.7+)
- **Database**: MongoDB 4.4+ required (previously 4.0+)
- **Dependencies**: Major dependency updates (see `requirements.txt`)
- **Configuration**: Environment variables now required for most settings
